# Group Anagrams

# Hints
# Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

# Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = ["x"]

# Output: [["x"]]
# Example 3:

# Input: strs = [""]

# Output: [[""]]
# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 10000.
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
# strs[i] is made up of lowercase English letters.
