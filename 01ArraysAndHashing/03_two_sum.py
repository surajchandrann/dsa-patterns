# Two Sum

# Hints
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

# You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

# Return the answer with the smaller index first.

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

# Output: [0,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

# Output: [0,1]
# Constraints:

# 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
# -10,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 10,000,000
# -10,000,000 <= target <= 10,000,000
# Only one valid answer exists.
